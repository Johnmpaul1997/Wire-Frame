  <h2>ORIGINS</h2>
  <p>MCR was the brain child of two brothers and their friends </p>
    
    <h2>GETTING STARTED</h2>
    
    <p> The Newark based band started in the year 2001.
        And their following continued to grow till the year 2013 </p>
    
        <h2>The Members and their story</h2>
    
        <p> Lead vocalist Gerard Way, Guitarists Ray Toro and Frank Iero, 
       Bassist Mikey Way and drummer Bob Bryar, accompanied by keyboardist James Dewees.
       Founded by Gerard, Mikey, Toro, and Matt Pelissier (and later joined by Iero), the
        band signed to Eyeball Records </p>
        
        <h2>Where are they now, you may ask?</h2>
        
        <p>The band broke up in 2013. There was no falling, they simply moved on.
            There has been a huge demand for a reunion tour
            ,but no such thing seems to be nearby to the dismay of their cultlike following </p>
